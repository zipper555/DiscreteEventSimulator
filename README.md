# DiscreteEventSimulator
Implementation of a Discrete Event Simulator (DES) of a GI/GI/1/S/âˆž queuing system. The simulator is programmed in Python in an object oriented fashion for the sake of simple extensibility and re-usability. This project was a part of the assignment for the course 'Analysis, Modeling and Simulation of Communication Networks' (EI7450) at Technical University of Munich.

## Implementation

 * Sever and Queue modeling
 * Eevent chain for event driven simulation
 * Packets, their arrival and service modeling.
 * Random number generation for various simulation events.
 * Statistical analysis by using Correlation, Confidence intervals and Chi square tests.
 * Plotting of results
